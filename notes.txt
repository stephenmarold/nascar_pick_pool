redux for login?

can only select driver once

mongo set up
- learn to insert picks
- set up race-tracker page
- learn to retrieve picks by username
- learn to retrieve all picks

api for getting feed
https://cf.nascar.com/cacher/live/live-feed.json currently works. Not sure if will need to use Swagger at some point, but swagger throws CORS errors
and...well...FUCK cors. 

figma!

aggregate picks into a leaderboard
display driver ticker, user ticker side by side

Design/quality ideas:
- Cards display (Select Drivers) when no drivers Selected [DONE]
- display selections outside of Dropdown (Selected State)
- responsive design for mobile
